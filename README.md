# SystemsOptimization
Development of a scheduling policy for sets of time-triggered and event-triggered
tasks applicable to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.  The project focused on
solving a combinatorial optimization problem using Python, implementing simulated
annealing techniques and heuristics to schedule time-triggered tasks using an ”earliest
deadline first” policy, analyze the schedulability of event-triggered tasks and assign
polling servers for the event-triggered tasks in an optimized way.
